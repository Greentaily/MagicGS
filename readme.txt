MagicGS - my first GS

** What is it? **

This small GS will connect all towns each to other using roads.
Those connection are done at map generation time and continues until all towns are connected.

The aim of this GS is to help getting :
- A more realistic world : noone knows a town that can't be reached by road...
- Allow players to focus on road transportation in the early ages without spending all their money building roads (as the road incomes are very small)

** What next? **

I have many ideas, but not sure about the time...

Feel free to give feedbacks about this GS on the forum thread.
